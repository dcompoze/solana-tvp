# Description

Initialization:

A creator who owns some SPL tokens can create a vesting schedule for a beneficiary.
The creator specifies:

- Start and end dates for the vesting period
- Total amount of tokens to vest
- Initial unlock amount (tokens available immediately)
 When initialized, the creator's tokens are transferred to a secure vault account controlled by the program

Vesting mechanism:

The program uses a linear vesting schedule between start and end dates:
If vesting 1000 tokens over 10 months with 100 initial unlock:
- 100 tokens are available immediately
- The remaining 900 tokens vest linearly (90 per month)
- After 5 months, ~550 tokens would be available (100 initial + ~450 vested)

Claiming process:

The beneficiary can call the claim instruction at any time.
The program:
- Calculates how many tokens have vested based on current time
- Subtracts any previously withdrawn amounts
- Transfers available tokens from the vault to the beneficiary
- If no new tokens have vested since the last claim, the transaction will fail

Security:

- Only the designated beneficiary can claim tokens
- Tokens are held in a program-controlled vault
- All math operations use checked arithmetic to prevent overflows
- The program uses PDAs (Program Derived Addresses) to securely control the vault

This design is useful for:

- Token distribution to team members/advisors
- Investor token unlocks
- Employee compensation packages
- Any scenario requiring gradual token distribution

The program could be extended to add features such as:

- Cliff periods (no tokens available until a certain date)
- Different vesting curves (e.g. exponential)
- Revocation capabilities
- Multiple beneficiaries
